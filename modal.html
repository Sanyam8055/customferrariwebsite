          <h3>Ferrari 275 GTB</h3>
          <p>For the 1965 racing season, 4 lightweight 275 GTB Competizione Speciales were built and equipped with 250 LM engines. For the 1966 season, Ferrari decided to build 12 lightweight 275 GTB/C cars, they were constructed between the end of the 275 two-cam production run and the start of the 275 four-cam production run. Two of the twelve built were sold for street use. Unlike the race cars, these street cars were fitted with alloy wheels shod with Pirelli tyres. Competition cars were fitted with special Borrani wire wheels, shod with Dunlop's latest racing tires. It was this combination that would prove to be the weak spot of the 275 GTB/C; the tyres had so much grip that they could overstress and break the spokes on the wheels. After the 275 GTB/C, no competition Ferrari would be fitted with wire wheels again.</p>

          <h3>Ferrari F40</h3>
          <p>The Ferrari F40 is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-door coup√© sports car produced by Ferrari from 1987 to 1992 as the successor to the Ferrari 288 GTO. From 1987 to 1989 it was Ferrari's fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car. The car had no traction control, and a rather agressive power delivery from it's twin turbo V8 engine...Rated by many as the greatest Supercar of them all, the F40 was the last car commissioned by the late Enzo Ferrari, to celebrate 40 years of production at Maranello. </p>
